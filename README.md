## Mantle Universal Business Process Library

A library of business process story and related documents. These are generic requirements for enterprise systems.

While you can view the documents directly they are all wiki files so the easiest way to view them is by adding this 
component to a Moqui Framework installation.

To add this component to Moqui the easiest approach is to use the Gradle get component task:

    $ ./gradlew getComponent -Pcomponent=mantle-ubpl
